-- Zero-shot prompt:
I am working on a terminology extraction project that considers the French-language terminology used in kitesurfing. Attached, I am providing a text sample of around 2 thousand tokens from the domain of kitesurfing. Considering the principles of Terminology, I need you to create a comprehensive list of kitesurfing terms present in the sample. These terms can be formed by single words, or they can be multiword terms, and a multiword term might be formed by different single-word terms (and all of them should be extracted). It is very important for the extracted list to be comprehensive and to contain all terms that appear in the provided sample. The list should be formatted as a single-column output, with one term per line. I don't need definition nor context of occurrence, but the extracted terms must appear in the sample that was provided.
